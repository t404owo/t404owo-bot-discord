## T404owo's bot Selfhosting
So some of you guys want to selfhost my own bot, and some has already selfhosted the prievous version.
During to Some Problems, I deleted the Arcaea Bot Project bcz it's Arcaea's ToS breaking.
And bcz some guys love spoonfeeding instead of coding their own bot, I refuse to let the selfhost continue existing.

There're some Rules before we start to selfhost my bot.
1. Code Fixing are not allowed, do it at your own risk.
2. Asking me for fixing any bugs are tolerated, but please don't ask me for give you more extend codes or ask me about how to fix the bug for your selfhosted bot.
3. I'm **not** responsible for the bad things what you did by your own with your self-hosted bot.(breaking any game's/app's ToS(Terms of Service), rules or guidelines e.g.)
4. Pushing Branch/codes are not tolerated, it will even being deleted or removed after you upload.
5. Do **not** use my codes for selling or misusing
6. You also have to Follow the [Code Of Conduct](https://github.com/t404owo/t404owo-bot-discord/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

If you agree with the rules, then we are going to the topic, please scroll under...



With this repl project, you have to use node-fetch to host 24/7, then start the bot, after that, get the link from the website that shows an "OK" (https://xxa.t404owo.repl.co e.g, xxa.t404owo is: project's name.owner of the project) and paste in the shard.ts and main.js

once you finished doing that, copy the code:
```json


{
  "DISCORD_BOT_EMBED_COLOR":"color in hex, or as word(#1f1e94, blue, white etc)",
  "DISCORD_BOT_PREFIX": "prefix here(+, -,...)",
  "VERSION": "",
  "DISCORD_BOT_OWNER": "your username and tag",
  "DISCORD_BOT_OWNER_ID": "",
  "DISCORD_BOT_USERNAME": "Bot's name here",
  "GENIUS": "",
  "DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN": "",
  "DISCORD_BOT_INVITE":"the invite code to your server without discord.gg/ or discord.com/invite(like hAFdT3s)"
}
```
Then click the button with the lock, then click the Open raw editor and put the code in it
after that fill the token, genius lyrics token, ... in the variables(after "="), make sure you delete the examples
The bot is now set up finished! If you want to change the bot's status, use `<prefix>setstatus <stream/watch/play/listening> <twitch username if you use stream> <game, status>`
